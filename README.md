# Elm Site Gen

This is an Elm-to-HTML static site generator. I use it for my personal site.

It started out as a fork of Alex Korban's excellent [Elmstatic](https://korban.net/elm/elmstatic).
You may want to take a look at his project for something more actively maintained.

Currently I'm just using this for my personal needs, and updates are irregular.
